            "This was the first \"Walking Tall\" movie I saw, I think in a $2 movie theater along Hollywood Blvd. , so I didn't have any reference to the first installment done by Joe Don Baker. I remember being shocked at the corrupted system of McNairy County and the brutality of the \"redneck gangs\". I was also amazed at the fact that one man decided he's not going to let it slide, and went out to do something about it. Courageous ? I thought so - to a point where it sent shivers up my spine.<br /><br />I think this movie is a great story about American courage to stand up and do something about a system that's only serving its own interest. I was pretty blown away about it, and think this is still one of the best movie of the hero/anti-hero genre, which one might laugh but includes recent movies like the \"The Punisher\", but even more so because it's a true story. The recent remake starring the \"Rock\" just doesn't do any justice to the real fire in the story of Buford Pusser.<br /><br />A \"classic\" that I'm sure will resurface again in the future.\n",

Maybe it\\'s the censor-baiting nature of the plot \\x96 a married man kills a femme fatale\\'s husband and gets away with it! \\x96 but King brings out the growing moral and theological complexities in Phillip Dunne\\'s script rather than upping the sin and sandals hokum. This is the conflicted David on the downhill slope, abandoned by a vengeful God he no longer understands, and the film doesn\\'t back away from the awkward unanswerable questions about why a loving deity would choose to wreak vengeance on the innocent rather than the guilty. It even offers a genuinely surprising criticism of the sexual inequality of the law, where the failings of husbands result in the punishment of their wives.<br /><br />Unlike King David, which sidelined the king in favour of the admittedly more interesting Saul, David is firmly at the centre of the drama and despite an interesting display of shoulder twitching and a frankly gormless overlong close-up when visiting the site of Saul and Jonathan\\'s death, Gregory Peck\\'s performance grows in stature as David shrinks. Susan Hayward is pure Hollywood pro, Raymond Massey is an appropriately theatrical prophet (why be naturalistic when you\\'ve got a voice that makes the very heavens quake?) and Kieron Moore\\'s Uriah such an intransigent unreconstructed chauvinist that you can\\'t exactly blame David for putting him in harm\\'s way, but despite threatening to soft peddle the film doesn\\'t allow David a moral get out of jail free card over his death. With surprisingly strong but subdued design and Technicolor photography this is definitely a cut above most 40s-50s Biblical epics.<br /><br />Fox\\'s new DVD is a good transfer, including an incredibly hokey \\'candid\\' behind-the-scenes short and a trailer with brief shots deleted from the film\\'s sole battle scene.\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0'}]\n",

It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup. The acting was so bad that I was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end. The lead by Casper Van Dien made me long for the high caliber acting of Steven Seagal in \"On Deadly Ground\" as his line reading was so wooden that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder. I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat . The direction was so abysmal I looked back yearning to my nephew\\'s grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage. The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade Z horror flicks from yesteryear. What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie. My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing. On a side note I noticed at IMDb that sometimes salaries for movies are published I was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies.

I watched it last night and I must admit, that I am deeply disappointed. If that is supposed to be \"the last best hope\" for entertaining and challenging German action cinema, well then there is not much left.<br /><br />\"Die Sieger\" tries to be sexy, daring and furious but it is nothing of that kind. The characters are wooden and stereotype and whenever they do something unexpected (which doesn\\'t happen too much) the act against their nature. That makes it hard - for me almost impossible - to follow them or even identify with them.<br /><br />Most of all I think the film is very bad cast. There is not one character in whom I believe. Maybe the superior officer at the SWAT unit - but that\\'s about it. Those people that try to look like or act like special units, like elite cops - I don\\'t believe them. Not for a second.<br /><br />The story is not so bad after all. But I think it\\'s badly told. You don\\'t get to know the bad guy at all - for example. And when after a \"very dark\" show down Karl Simon (the good guy) asks his already dead opponent \"why? ... what for?\" I did ask myself that very same question, knowing, that Dominik Graf wouldn\\'t have the answer.<br /><br />I sincerely hope - no - I believe that Germany can do better, even with action films.\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n###'}]\n",

Filmed with his fave duo (Depardieu and Dewaere) and the usual dose of sex (Miou-Miou plays her typical role, at least the one from the seventies as little could we know that a decade later she would be the best French actress ever). In first \"Les Valseuses\" is also one of the first roadmovies as the viewer is just taken to some journeys of two little criminals. Those who only are satisfied with family life, or simply know nothing more, the movie would be quite a shocker but this movie is more than just that, it just let you think of all the usual things in life (working for the car, being bounded at work etc.). It\\'s a sort of critic towards the hypocrite society we\\'re living in. Great job and it just makes you wish two things : Dewaere died just too young as he was a topactor and of course Depardieu, he\\'d better should have stuck with French movies as he proves here that no one can beat him.

Little in the film is true except the name of the island and the fact submarines were involved. Little more than training film quality with poor camera work, muddy stock footage and perhaps the low point of stereotyping 'Japs' with laughing Japanese infantry, laughing Japanese fighter pilots and one-dimensional square-jawed Americans dying left and right. Sixty years later it is unintentionally funny as an odd artifact and as an opportunity to see what is possible when the war fever is upon you. The plot and the dialogue remind me of playing guns on a summer's afternoon in my childhood, peering through the neighbor's hedge to gain a fatal advantage on my best friend Steve and my little brother. In actual fact, the Makin Island raid was a near total failure with Carlson and his men wandering around in the dark exchanging gunfire with shadows until finally, thirsty and completely disoriented, looking for someone to surrender to, before they happened upon some equally confused Japanese soldiers who promptly surrendered to them! In the withdrawal several of Carlson's Marines ended up on another island and were abandoned! The film, of course, couldn't tell that story, not in 1943, so this bit of whimsy was fabricated and rushed into release to the beating of drums. With Randolph Scott, and his jaw, as Colonel Thorwald (Carlson) leading a unit comprised almost entirely of stock caricatures, the green recruit (Harry Landon, Robert Mitchum), the grizzled veteran (J. Carroll Naish, Milburn Stone, Sam Levene), the country-bumpkin (Rod Cameron), the all-American boy (Alan Curtis), and scores of sneering (when they weren't laughing) 'Japs'. And yet the cast nearly overcomes the material. Almost. Randolph Scott's narrow range is well suited to his role of earnest commander and he is supported by a solid group of professionals who do their best with thin gruel. But in the end, the one-note object of the exercise wins. Any pretense is totally abandoned at the close when Randy Scott simply looks directly into the camera and delivers a stirring (well sorta stirring) call to arms. The cast was better than this material. So was the audience. Should be viewed with Reefer Madness and a bottle of moderately priced Merlot.\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\"}]\n",

No character should be so tied to an an actor that no one else ever be allowed to play him or her again!<br /><br />I thought it was good fun and an interesting updating of the classic programmers of the thirties and forties. Though guilty of some bad acting, this is earnest enough and unpretentious, making it hard for me to dislike.<br /><br />The whole production is a bit odd though, but I really enjoyed the scenes between Sheen and Carridine. The fact that we're watching a story within a story makes the oddness and exaggerations more palatable.\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n\"}]\n",

It is a slow-moving but fascinating film for those who are willing to go along with it. An Australian properties lawyer is asked to take on the case of five aborigines accused in the murder of one of their own. All sorts of portents and omens soon pop up, as the man's death involves a tribal issue that was not meant for white man's court, and pretty soon the lawyer is having trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy. It looks like the end of the world may be at hand, and he and the aborigines may know this but no one else does. Richard Chamberlain as the lawyer is at his peak here. David Guptil, a familiar face from several other Australian flicks and a decent actor, is one of the five aborigines on trial. THE LAST WAVE is simply not for everyone, anymore than is MAGNOLIA (both happen to have strange things falling from the sky).

Okay perhaps it didn't have some of the features it was meant to have but Digital Anvil have still come up with a good game. There is a certain similarity to Elite(you can trade, pick up weapons and cargo off destroyed ships, go on missions)however this game features a heavily scripted mission. It is a great mission. The control system is different it uses the mouse! You basically fly you spaceship around a system and work your way up! The game features some pretty good graphics even through it was made in 2003. It should run well on even a modestly specified PC. The story features some great voice acting from John Rhys Davies, George Takei, Jennifer Hale(she appears in every computer game). Stick with the story it gets better and better as it goes on. There is even a race section, where you and an opponent have to race your spaceships around a course(it involves you going through rings). This section took me a while to beat. It adds variety to the game. Some sections are a little tough here and there but overall you can beat this game. The game has an active mod scene on the Net. Pick up some mods to extend the game. I haven't played any of the mods yet. <br /><br />Sadly a sequel to this was cancelled, a shame!\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0\"}]\n",

The goal is survival within a particular kind of life style. The novel is full of malice. The only relationship that rings emotionally true is that between Sherman and his daughter, Campbell, and that\\'s only touched upon. That aside, everyone is out for what he can get in the way of publicity, power, money or self aggrandizement.<br /><br />Wolfe was criticized for hitting every character and every social segment of New York City over the head. His response was a denial. After all, he lived in New York himself and belonged to a neighborhood improvement committee and other admirable organizations, exactly the qualifications one would want on his resume in order to deny that he disliked New Yorkers. (Wolfe has a PhD in American Studies from Yale and is no dummy.) Those supposed weaknesses are what made the novel memorable. Nobody was any good. And Sherman McCoy wound up broke, a professional protester for social justice. The movie throws all of that away and imposes a moral frame on the story that simply doesn\\'t fit. Wolfe did his homework. The novel was rooted in reality. Every event was not only possible but thoroughly believable. Wolfe might have made a great cultural anthropologist -- he knows how to get inside a system and record its details.<br /><br />Yes, any of us might have found ourselves, as Sherman and his mistress do, stuck in the South Bronx, threatened by a couple of black kids, and making a getaway after bumping into one of them. That scene is transferred neatly from print to celluloid. <br /><br />But after that scene the movie seems not to trust its audience and at times become frantic in its attempt to spell out its message, however nebulous the message is. <br /><br />Sherman might accidentally hit some kid and be arrested for it as he is in the novel, but he would not immediately upon his release from jail go back to his phenomenally expensive condo, take out a shotgun, and start shooting into the ceiling with it, as he does in the movee. In what\\'s supposed to be a funny scene, ceiling plaster falls all over the party guests and they scurry away, shrieking. It simply would not have happened. The movie has left the novel\\'s unspeakably detailed reality in the dust. Wolfe\\'s sensibility, the work he put into capturing the real, has been lost. What we get instead is a noisy, fantastic, and silly scene that doesn\\'t do anything except wake the audience up. Similar empty scenes follow, screaming out for Wolfe\\'s verisimilitude.<br /><br />The movie also fails because it thrusts a lot of sin and redemption into an entertaining story of moral nihilism. Here we see \"Don Juan in Hell\" at the opera. We get lectures on redemption from a poet with AIDs. We see a lot of guilt in Sherman. A black judge who preaches from the bench and gives one of those final speeches about how we all have to start behaving nicely again. A reporter who feels sorry for Sherman after turning him into a sacrificial lamb. And a happy ending in which Sherman gets off by breaking the law with an idiotic grin. The scene sits on the movie like a jester\\'s cap on a circus elephant\\'s head. <br /><br />The movie not only makes points that are already trite and unoriginal, it overstates them, as if the audience were incapable of absorbing any subtleties.<br /><br />It\\'s not the acting or the direction that\\'s poor. The film\\'s not bad in those respects. And the photography is pretty good too, including two rather spectacular shots -- the gargoyles of the Chrysler building and the landing of the Concorde. It\\'s the script that is thoroughly botched.<br /><br />The first half of the movie, roughly, is okay in conception and execution. It keeps some of the little details from the novel. Sherman and Judy\\'s dog is named Marshall. Who the hell would name a dog Marshall? It loses its focus almost completely in the second half and on the whole is barely worth watching.<br /><br />Wolfe\\'s cynical redneck right-wingism may be offensive to a lot of people, but he\\'s got the cojones to lay his percepts out. Alas the writers and producers did not have the courage to pick them up and thus blew the chance to make a fascinating study of New Yorkers.\\n\\n### Answer\\n0'}]\n",

It is a first-class adventure for many reasons, I suggest--fine photography, strong imaginative qualities, a delightful cast, good simulated-jungle locales and a very exciting storyline. Johnny Weissmuller plays Tarzan, a mono-syllabic untutored sort unlike Edgar Rice Burroughs\\' creation; but he is honest, loyal, brave and very courageous, and he needs to be during this narrative. As Jane Parker, his wife who had been Jane Porter in the novels, Maureen O\\'Sullivan is very attractive and lively, as well as being athletic where the script calls for that quality. The effect of the lighting, the spacious and clever sets is quite unusual. This is an outdoor adventure filmed on the MGM back-lot which really works. The fabulous Mutir Escarpment is a remote locale which allows Tarzan and Jane to live undisturbed; but into their idyll come people searching from them, emissaries of a civilization Jane has left behind and into which Tarzan could not really be comfortably habituated. One is Harry Holt, still in love with her, who with his friend tempts her to come back to civilization with him; the gown and perfumes interest her, but she refuses to leave Tarzan. Tarzan has to protect her against several wild animals, in scenes that look like a humanized King King. The group claim to want to hunt animals, and Tarzan agrees for Jane\\'s sake to a bit of big game trapping; but at some point, the idea of ivory and of obtaining a fortune turns the expedition\\'s heads\\' minds. Tarzan is shot, left for dead; and the group force Jane to accompany them on an expedition as they follow a dying elephant to the fabulous \"elephant\\'s graveyard\". But they find the area guarded by a savage tribe and are attacked by lions. Tarzan rides in on an elephant he has revived in time to call; in a most spectacular elephant-filled scene, he saves Jane and what is left of the expedition, who return home little richer but much wise, as Jane continues her savage idyll with her new husband. The film was directed by set-design wizard Cedric Gibbons, and quite beautifully too. His work and the lighting are the outstanding accomplishments of this entertaining and exciting film,which manages to seem real despite all its Hollywood shortcomings from start to finish. Neil Hamilton is a very good Harry, Paul Cavanagh is even better before and after he reveals himself to be thoroughly bad. Forrester Harvey and Nathan Curry round out a small cast very professionally. An unusual and well-realized fantasy film with interesting situations and some strong dialogue confrontations as well.

Perhaps the plot is not intended to hang together logically. Or perhaps these rough spots are in the plot because Ann's recall of distant events is rather faulty.<br /><br />Take the young Ann Grant (Claire Danes). Here is a young woman who has attended an unnamed college with the scions of a rich family. She must have had help to afford this very expensive education, but never seems to have any family ties at all. She never seems to have any relatives she can turn to when the consequences of one of her disastrous decisions take effect.<br /><br />Ann shares an evening of passion with her great love Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson). Then, when Harris comforts Lila after the tragic death of her brother Buddy, Ann suddenly finds him repulsive and is disgusted with her own behavior. I must have missed something significant here. Ann's behavior seems totally inexplicable. Ann abandons her relationship with Harris and eventually marries one of the groomsmen at Lila's wedding. Despite Ann's rejection of Harris, she continues to hold deep feelings for him on her deathbed.<br /><br />It was obvious from his behavior that Harris was deeply smitten with Ann and would have gladly married her. A scene showing their chance meeting years after Lila's wedding showed that Harris still had deep feelings for Ann.<br /><br />The film showed a pattern for Ann's romantic relationships. She always had a falling out with her men and she rejected them. This pattern held with Harris and two husbands. In contrast, Lila married a man she did not love and she remained with her husband until he died. Perhaps Lila was able to build a relationship because she refused to let her marriage fail.<br /><br />Then came the too convenient reappearance of Lila Ross at Ann's bedside. Apparently Ann's nurse was able to extract enough information from Ann's last few lucid moments to identify and contact Lila. None of this communication appeared on the film.<br /><br />I kept wondering about the house Ann was living in during her final days. How did she afford to buy such a house on the meager earnings of her singing career? Ann always seemed one step ahead of financial disaster while raising her two daughters.<br /><br />On another level, I enjoyed the film's setting and music immensely. The seaside mansion was just so heartbreakingly beautiful. Claire Danes was luminous as the young Ann Grant. She is really quite a talented singer. I much prefer her natural brunette to the bottle blonde look she had in the film extras. If only those pesky CGI fireflies would go away, I could raise the movie a whole point in my vote!\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</0\"}]\n",

The gargantuan Hollywood studios in the 30\\'s and 40\\'s were able to copy some of the German expressionistic film elements and incorporate them into Hollywood films. very good use of shadows and light and silhouette. i really liked the scene where colman turns off the light in his dressing room near the beginning of the film, and he starts reciting Othello while his face becomes instantly dark and evil. already the viewer sees the text and the drama of Shakespeare getting a hold of \"Tony\" and off he goes on his journey of doom. i also enjoyed the dramatic death scene within the play, when he becomes overwrought with emotion and accidentally strangles his costar a little too hard for her to bear. her pleadings \"tony stop you\\'re hurting me\" are chilling and suspenseful. you just don\\'t know if he is going to go over the top and kill her at any moment. the cat and mouse chase to reveal the killer was nicely added 2/3rds of the way through the film to add some faster pacing and to also add to the narrative element of the film. Masterful work from George Cukor. He\\'s such as skillful director. Excellent film.

In truth for me her performance is not held back by her beauty but makes it all the more stark in the terror of the sadistic brutality as a resistor she faces. Maruschka Detmers performance is brave, poignant, heartfelt or understood, and totally believable. In other words for me \"In the zone.\" from the opening credits. If you would like to learn about the suffering of someone else for something they believe in and be impressively entertained give Hanna\\'s War with Maruschka Detmers a try. My hat is off also to Ellen Burstyn as Hanna\\'s mother a much well known and famous actress who could have made effort to walk off with the film.

Isn't the fundamental rule for science fiction/drama to create in the audience the willing suspension of disbelief. POA 2001 creates a plausible beginning, suckering us in, but thereinafter Mr. Burton forgets that his moviegoers have working brains. The over the top libertarian of Helena Bonham Carter's chimp, the worthlessness of the humans' lockup, the ease of their escape, their extraordinary skills of horsemanship (this is an astronaut and a group of human primitives suddenly riding full tilt), the massive and immediate human rebellion all are too unbelievable. Mark Wahlberg never once projects any sense of real fear, danger or comeuppance in this world turned upside down. Compare to the original, in which Chuck Heston's nakedness metaphorically captured his utter helplessness and astonishment at his turn of events. The uniformed Wahlberg preserves his modesty, but also his apparent sense of management and control in an inherently wacky situation, and we never really wonder about his well being. Unlike Heston, he seems never to be in real jeopardy. Tim Burton should have used some of the f/x budget for some competent screenwriting. In fact, after this inferior fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood's producers ever bothered to settle the screenwriters and directors strike threats. Let them walk. Trained monkeys could have done as well as they did in Planet of the Apes 2001. I'll bet the repeat viewings of this effort will be nonexistent. It could have been a new franchise, and a wonderful new step for imagination.

While Ms. Peterson has taken on various supporting roles in motion pictures, covering a wide variety in genres, it was her TV-character Elvira that brought her the most fame. Part of her charm \\x96 and respect from the fans \\x96 lies in the fact she never turned her back on the horror genre that made her famous (unlike many other big name actors & actresses that like to distantiate themselves from their \"early\" work). I\\'ve seen only bits & pieces of her TV performances, but her cameo role in Ghoultown\\'s recent tribute song \"Mistress of the Dark\" really encouraged me to check out more of her stuff. One thing had been clear to me already long before this music video: Over the years, Elvira had become a force of influence herself by the time the mid-80\\'s came around.<br /><br />And in 1988, after films like \"Fright Night\" and \"TerrorVision\" incorporated homages to and spoofs on her TV-work, it finally happened: \"Elvira, Mistress of the Dark\", the motion picture. Now, I had seen the trailer for it already back in the VHS rental days, but it took me until last week to finally see the actual film. A few years ago, I did manage to watch \"Elvira\\'s Haunted Hills\" (made in 2001), but for some reason it didn\\'t impress me all that much. Was it really that forgettable, or should I give it another watch? I actually really do feel like re-watching it now, as this first Elvira film from \\'88 really convinced me. Though perhaps partly responsible for making this film work, might be Sam Egan and John Paragon with their contributions to the script, there really is no way to deny it: Cassandra Peterson has a great feel for comedy (she also co-wrote the screenplay).<br /><br />When Elvira learns she\\'s one of the beneficiaries of a Great Aunt (she never heard of before), she takes it as the long cherished opportunity to start up her own show in Las Vegas. Out to claim her rightfully inherited money, she travels to a quiet New England town. But the uptight townspeople of Falwell are in for a treat. In less than no time she manages to shock and insult all noteworthy inhabitants of the conservative little town with her (often unintentionally) provocative behaviour. To make things worse, her inheritance turns out not to be what she expected: A rundown mansion, a cookbook and a poodle. But what she doesn\\'t know, and her evil uncle Vincent Albot does, is that her Great Aunt was a witch, and the cookbook contains recipes to concoct the most hellishly dark powers imaginable. And if you haven\\'t turned off the movie yet by the time Elvira has cooked up her first dish from the recipe-book, then rest assured, you\\'re going to sit out this ride with a smile on your face.<br /><br />It\\'s surprising how a script rigged together with boob-jokes, witty one-liners, movie references, inside jokes and bade taste merriment also manages to tell a coherent story. Simple, of course, but coherent. While other movies, heavily relying on gag-like situations, often make you loose track of the story completely (like the \"Naked Gun\" films, for example), this film doesn\\'t. A lot of horror-comedies were being produced during the 80\\'s, but not a lot of them actually worked. Let alone a horror-spoof that doesn\\'t derail at some point (\"Killer Party\", although I\\'m grateful for this one going completely bonkers during the finale) or becomes too tedious too quickly (\"Saturday the 14th\"). Although \"Elvira\" is more comedy than horror, it doesn\\'t loose track of what it\\'s doing and consistently builds up towards a mildly grotesque finale, complete with a supernatural showdown in the streets of Falwell between newborn witch Elvira and evil uncle wizard Talbot, including a real honest-to-god witch hunt and Elvira\\'s very own burn-at-the-stake moment.<br /><br />I\\'m telling you, there\\'s no power in hell that could make this movie unfunny. One of the first giggles I got was during the opening credits already, when Daniel Greene\\'s name appeared. Daniel who? Oh yes, I recognized his name (and later on his dim-witted macho-face). How can one not forget Daniel Greene once you\\'ve seen... \"Atomic Cyborg aka Fists of Steel\"! But if you haven\\'t seen \"Atomic Cyborg\", then I\\'m sorry, but you won\\'t be able to laugh with his face in this one. And on a side-note: I never could have imagined Elvira looking this cool while ignorantly driving away from a gas station. Even Robert Rodriguez could not have made that shot look any better.\\n\\n### Answer\\n1'}]\n",

First Pachelbel's Canon brought a lump to my throat, then the sight of a Tiger Moth (which my grandfather, my father and I have all flown) produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then Crowe's name hooked me completely. I was entranced by this film, Crowe's performance (again), the subject matter (and yes, what a debt we owe), how various matters were addressed and dealt with, the flying sequences (my father flew Avro Ansons, too), the story - and, as another contributor pointed out, Crowe's recitation of High Flight.

Naturally, being a fan of the TMNT back in the day, this obviously peaked my interest. So when I started watching the show... to say I was disappointed by the end result is an understatement. Some time later (more like recently), I got a chance to revisit the series.<br /><br />First off, let's talk about some of the positives. They managed to re-create the Turtles' lair as it was last seen in the movies fairly well given the limited budget they threw in with this. There tends to be this darker atmosphere overall in terms of the sets and whatnot. And the Turtle suits, while not the greatest piece of puppetry and whatnot, were functional and seemed pretty sturdy for most of the action stuff that would follow in the series.<br /><br />People tend to complain about getting rid of Shredder quickly and replacing him with these original villains who could have easily been used in a Power Rangers show. But you can only have Shredder get beat so many times before it gets boring and undermines his worth as a villain... and besides, most fans don't realize or don't remember or just plain ignore the fact that in the original comic, the Shredder was offed in the very first issue! Never mind the countless resurrections that would follow. So on a personal standpoint, I was sort of glad they got rid of Shredder because then the anticipation would build to the point where they would eventually bring him back in a later episode. I find that Shredder in small quantities work best because then his encounters with the Turtles are all the more memorable.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they end up replacing him with these original villains who, as stated, seemed more fit for a Power Rangers show than a Ninja Turtles show. And with these new magic-wielding generics comes a new female magic-wielding turtle, the infamous Venus De Milo. I'll be honest; I never got comfortable with her. I'm not against the idea of a female turtle; I'm just against the idea of one who uses magic and thus sticks out like a sore sight among a clan of ninja turtles who seem somewhat out of their domain. I almost get the impression that this could have easily been the Venus De Milo show dealing with her make-believe enemies and the TMNT are just there to provide the star power (or whatever was left considering the timeframe this was released). Fortunately, they all share the spotlight together.<br /><br />Next Mutation was canned after a season on the air and the creators were more than happy to ignore it. Given time and maybe another season, I really believe this live iteration of the TMNT could have been something and might have gotten a chance at greatness. But while the idea was sound, the execution was flawed (although there are a couple good episodes in this series). As it stands, Next Mutation is one of those oddities in Turtledom that is best left buried and forgotten.\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</\"}]\n",

I thought Uwe Boll's alone in the dark was the worst i've seen yet but at least i gave it a 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion(Stephen Dorff shooting at nothing made me laugh so i boosted the ratings a bit). Hell if it was if compared to bloodrayne, Bloodrayne would win a Oscar for best movie if they were competing.<br /><br />Now to the plot, this movie is about the BTK killer which is fine but they've could have done better. The start looked OK but that's it I had to fast forward most of it because the death's where boring. I like killer movies and even if they suck they could still get some cool deaths. I'm not a fancy movie expert but believe me he would have shot himself if did see this. Sorry for rambling but there's nothing good to say about it, because it looks like someone took a camcorder and film this.. this.. thing of disaster. Uwe Boll your movies are no longer on my list of worst movies ever this took the cake.<br /><br />Well sorry i couldn't explain the plot(if there was one) but that was the best i could. Now if you don't mind i'm going to crawl into a corner and move back and forth and reminding me of how bad this movie scared me for life....

I wasn't expecting a lot (though the festival's director told me it was one of the best films submitted). Five minutes into it I was sold. Shot in B & W on a shoestring budget, this film is hilarious. The acting is solid, the writing is solid and the look of the film is solid. The acting is probably the biggest revelation, since most films shot on low budgets tend to have amateur or stagey acting. Not this one. It features one of the most convincing, endearing and funny portrayals of a character with Tourette's Syndrome I've ever seen. The plot is convoluted without being confusing and raunchy without being gratuitous. If you get the chance, see this movie. Filmmakers like Majkowski (hope I got that right) deserve the chance to strut their stuff to a wider audience.\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s\"}]\n",

Just the phrase, \"made of TV\", makes me shudder. The production values for made for TV movies are almost always remarkably lower than production values for professional movie studios. That being said, this version of the \"Christmas Carol\" should have been released in theaters, because it IS that good. It\\'s my personal favorite of all the \"Christmas Carol\" movies because every aspect of this production are of the highest quality. Yes, there are some minor on screen glitches with two of the ghosts that visit Scrooge, but there isn\\'t a movie in existence that doesn\\'t have at least a couple of mistakes.<br /><br />Scott turns in a stellar performance as Scrooge, he\\'s a pleasure to watch. In fact, I can\\'t think of one performance in this film that shouldn\\'t be applauded. The costuming, location shooting, and winter backdrop are mesmerizing. The musical score is endearing and heart warming. Add to that, solid directing, flawless cinematography, and faithful scripting; we have here what will one day be considered a holiday classic. It really hasn\\'t been around long enough to be a classic, but mark my words, one day soon it will be. This film has turned into a yearly Christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning behind Christmas: Love, selflessness, and giving. In as selfish, greedy world, my family and I can lose ourselves in \"The Christmas Carol\", starring George C.

With essentially no budget with which to operate, it is a grave mistake to attempt the depiction of such a gamut of events as those within this scenario and, in particular, special effects of space opera warfare which appear only clownish, while seeds from the scriptors' imagination lie fallow due to some of the most fatuous misunderstanding of basic scientific principles to be found. Among these are frequent firing of weapons within a sealed environment, and a wayward law of gravity which enables freedom of movement of cast members while inanimate objects float weightlessly, but it is easier to accept these than it is to pretend that any of the episodes have a basis in plausibility. The plot involves an escape of life sentenced prisoners from a space station penal colony to a waste landfill upon our moon and their various attempts to obtain passage back to Earth, with some few capable players present who are execrably directed by first-timer Paolo Mazzucato, whose production team wastes effort upon such as holographic pornography while ignoring a pressing and basic requirement for the creation of states of suspense and of impetus.<br /><br />\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n\"}]\n",

Although it was a part of the BETTY BOOP Series, Miss B. only made a brief appearance in the short; leaving the rest as a pilot episode for the possible emergence of a full blown series.<br /><br />AS is now common knowledge, the gruff, squinty eyed, brawlin\\' seaman became perhaps the most successful cartoon series ever; outlasting and literally outliving the Fleischers and their Studio, lasting to this day.<br /><br />RETURNING to King Features for another try at luck was no doubt the reason for trying out the very popular HENRY Comic Strip character in a BETTY BOOP outing; objective being the seeking of another series. The reasoning then surely seemed sound. HENRY was a most popular feature in the Hearst Papers\\' line-up; appearing as both a Daily and on Sunday\\'s Color Comics Supplement, PUCK, THE COMICS WEEKLY. You know, \"What Fools These Mortals Be!\" Remember that one, Schultz? IN viewing the chubby, little, bald boy Comic Strip \\'Hero\\' and his on screen antics, both solo and in tandem with Miss Betty; we were pleasantly surprised in seeing just how well the character was handled. The story and Director Dave Fleischer both afforded a plethora of comic strip-like situations and sight gags that seemed most appropriate for the character of little Henry. These mostly silent vignettes were very important to the animated film in remaining faithful to the printed page; as the HENRY Feature was mostly done in a sort of 4 color \\'mime\\'.<br /><br />IN the cartoon, titled BETTY BOOP WITH HENRY: THE FUNNIEST LIVING American (Fleischer Studios/Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1935), we see what is; basically being a one situational exercise; being punctuated with the usual array of Dave Fleischer\\'s rapid fire, machine gun-like gags. In short, Henry spots a puppy in the window of Betty Boop\\'s Pet Shop. It is a sort of love at first sight as Henry attempts to purchase the little pup dog with the only money he had, to coins in his pocket. He is in formed by Miss Boop that it would be $2.00 in depression era money to make the purchase. Tears appear as the little guy leaves dejectedly.<br /><br />BUT a reprieve is soon on the horizon as Betty asks the boy to mind the store, while she leaves on urgent business. In return for his services, Miss Betty promises him the little dog in return. Of course, they have a deal and Betty leaves.<br /><br />GETTING to the work of cleaning cages and feeding the livestock affords the opportunity for the Fleischer Crew to fire up a whole new string of gags; this time featuring bird seed, Henry\\'s bald pate and push brooms. (But not all at once of course, Schultz!) Henry\\'s enthusiasm for mass feeding of the store\\'s avian population by first literally seeding his head soon leads to a mass defection of the birds; out of the store to the open street in a mass jail break.<br /><br />BETTY returns to this sight and expresses her disappointment and anger with Henry\\'s temporary custodial care. All bets were off, no doggie for Henry. He begins to leave; dejectedly; but soon convinces the proprietress to give him another shot at fixing things up. His head covered with bird seed, he manages to corral all of the little feathered creatures; returning them to their pet store coop. Happily, the little fella leaves; but this time he has his own affectionate, little, face licking puppy.<br /><br />UNDOUBETLY this was a winning combination. We have the carefree, energy filled, free wheeling of the boy, the kindness of Betty and the emotions of the situation and doubtful outcome of the \\'boy and his dog\\' situation. Max and Dave Fleischer had given us a sort of almost minor mini-masterpiece of a surreal comedy short.<br /><br />WE were quite surprised that no HENRY Series followed. Judging by the fairly faithful treatment of the character, it certainly could have been sustained for some time. At any rate, this teaming was in many ways the best of the Betty Boop try out pictures. Although the first, POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer/Paramount, 1933), was the most successful (and barely had any Betty Boop in it, save for a cameo as a carnival hula dancer); the HENRY Short was much better than the two following King Features \"tryouts\", BETTY BOOP AND THE LITTLE KING and BETTY BOOP AND LITTLE JIMMY, both 1936.<br /><br />POODLE SCHNITZ!!\\n\\n### Answer\\n1'}]\n",

From the atrocious wooden acting to the dull, plodding pace, the puerile exploitation angle and the sophomoric pseudolesbian titillation added purely for the sake of the sad viewers, this is a disaster of a film.<br /><br />The plot is predictable, as from the beginning one is absolutely certain of what will happen to all of the characters and how the plot will commence. From a boring, unexceptional beginning to a pathetic and bleak ending, every single presence in this film is wasted, and every meagre scrap of talent dug up for this turkey is squandered.<br /><br />If you want to watch something as relentlessly bleak with plenty of the same childish titillation, watch one of the Ilsa films. At least they're unapologetic and up-front about what they're trying to do. How something this horrendously bad ever managed to be rated above a 5 is a miracle of how people with no taste or discerning standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious of purposes.<br /><br />It's not scary, it's not interesting, and above all it's not arousing in any sense of the word. It is, in my opinion, a crime; it is a crime that such a horribly offensive and incompetent piece of trash was ever conceived of and given the resources to come into existence, and even more a tragedy that it is still defended by some woefully misguided viewers.<br /><br />Not even Elvira's cheerful personality and joking ways could soften the blow that this horrifying travesty of film is.

The director knew what he had to work with and catered towards Rudy Ray Moore's limitations as an actor. It's a fun movie that's more technically sound and acted. The performers don't take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time around everyone is on the joke and goes with the flow. Rudy Ray Moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and not as stiff like he was in Dolemite.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film very much and I highly recommend it. Just like his first film, it's catered towards a certain audience (I highly doubt that Mr. Moore was trying to broaden his audience at this point in his career).

Because the folks at Crown International were so key, they haven\\'t been elevated to the status they richly deserve. A film like THE VAN may now seem like a disposable piece of Drive-in esoteria, but it was a sizable hit when it was released (not to mention subsequent re-releases as a double feature with other Crown hits).<br /><br />THE VAN was a perfect example of Crown\\'s hit strategy of seizing upon the mood of movie-goers at the time of a film\\'s release. Here, it was sex, drugs, rock \\'n roll and the brief \"Custom Van\" fad. As others have noted, it is ironic that the \"hit\" song in the film refers to a Chevy when the title vehicle is a Dodge in the film itself. I had a town Selectman where I was at the time even declare these vans to be \"dens of sin on wheels!\" A perfect ad line for the film!<br /><br />There are the usual assortment of \"good\" and \"bad\" girls, muscle-heads and low-brow hijinks (including a supporting bit by Danny DeVito). In many ways this isn\\'t much different from the old Beach Party movies of the 60\\'s, but now spiced up with Nudity and Drug use. Obviously done on a limited budget and a limited schedule, the film coasts along pleasantly enough with a breezy charm that compensates for some, by today\\'s standards certainly, un-PC views of women.<br /><br />The classic touch is a Toaster for Bobby\\'s den of sin on wheels.

Solid support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks, and Astrid Allwyn.<br /><br />Terrific songs include \"Let Yourself Go,\" \"Let\\'s Face the Music,\" and \"Putting All My Eggs in One Basket.\" The last song is introduced by Astaire playing a jazzy piano and then a cute dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings \"Let Yourself Go\" with Grable among the backup singers.<br /><br />Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two nice songs and plays Rogers\\' mousy sister. \"Get Thee Behind Me\" is a song that sticks with you for days. She also sings \"But Where Are You?\" Snappy and fast paced, this entry in the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the better ones. The classic and amazing beautiful finale, \"Let\\'s Face the Music and Dance\" is among the best-known of their numbers. Rogers wears one of the great dresses in movie history.... a shimmering sequined number that swirls around her legs as she dances (weighted hem) and is also slightly see through. Just gorgeous. This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters re-created in Pennies from Heaven.<br /><br />Randolph Scott seems an odd choice as Astaire\\'s pal but he also appeared in their Roberta with Irene Dunne. Luckily he does not attempt to sing or dance. It seems that Grable and Ball would have had bigger parts in 1936 but they have a few scenes and make little impact. Allwyn has the bigger role but is only OK.<br /><br />Rogers has one of her best solo numbers in the series with \"Let Yourself Go\".... Jazzy and thumping, it\\'s a great song.<br /><br />Fun all the way, although I got tired of \"We Joined the Navy\" after the third time....\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</'}]\n",

Cruel Intentions, in my opinion, was one of the best teen-oriented films made in years. This prequel had certain things incongruent with the original. (Sebastian's father married into wealth, then why does he have a rich Aunt on long island?)<br /><br />Then I found out today that it was not really intended to be a new movie, but rather a television series, Manchester Prep. After hearing that, it made sense to me that it wasn't the same as the movie, just as Buffy the Vampire Slayer is different in TV form. <br /><br />I think that Roger Kumble most likely added the ending that this movie had, AFTER the series wasn't picked up by Fox. It just seems like something that would happen too fast (Sebastian becoming the male version of Katharyn) and I just don't know where they would go with the next episode, since it wouldn't be leading to the 1999 Film (Which the newer ending is directed right towards.)<br /><br />One thing I didn't like was that it suggested Sebastian and his father had married into the wealth, which isn't typically looked good upon in this area of new york, and sine Katharyn's mother was just an adult version of her, it didn't seem like something a woman in her position would do, marry a man not of her social class. <br /><br />As a prequel this is fairly lame. But I would have been interested to see where this had gone as a series.\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s\"}]\n",

It is filled with Super-surfer Greg Noll's home movies, and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his 50-year passion. Nevertheless, it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory. It is filled with artistic talent, and athletic talent, however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic. Surfers are not astronauts nor test-pilots. Nor are they surgeons(perhaps) or Ph.d's(again, perhaps). It believes in the quest of the surfer. It believes in the beauty of human goofiness. It believes in the great gift of peace, which comes from the cessation of war. Surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an Hawaiian island attacked by Japanese zeroes fifteen years before. It celebrates the down-time of a country which fought a cold war-instead of a hot-war - with the Russian socialists. Surfing is the ultimate narcissism. It is dangerous, but only slightly historical. I suspect Alexander the Great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique. He had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received. This movie has no military heroes. It has no guns. The only beach-head surfers conquer has a beer-stand and and a surfboard shop. This is not a problem. Peace is not desperate. It is the joy of exhalation.\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s'\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n##\"}]\n",

The woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story, that is not only a comedy, but also an action anime. The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome, a teenager boy who is also an expert in martial arts. Ranma is engaged to Akane because of an arrangement of both fathers, who are great friends and trained together during many years. <br /><br />Akane is the younger and most violent sister of the Tendo\\'s: Kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and Nabiki is the middle and loves to win money no matter what.<br /><br />Ranma and Akane fight all the time,specially because both have a very bad temper, and when they discover that Ranma becomes a girl when splashed with cold water as well as his father becomes a panda,many new characters and situations starts to happen. They also discover the reason of the transformation: while fighting, Ranma and his father fell in a cursed river. But not only them had this kind of fate...<br /><br />If you watched \\'\\'Ranma 1/2\\'\\' and liked, I would recommend you \\'\\'Inuyasha\\'\\' and \\'\\'Maison Ikkoku\", two other good creations from Rumiko\\'s hands.\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n'}]\n",

Seen today, some might dismiss them or just see them as propaganda--which they technically are, but of a positive sort and meant to unify the nation. This film is a pretty effective and entertaining example of the genre--having a pretty realistic script and good production values. Pat O\\'Brien plays pretty much the same character he played in MANY other films (you know, the tough-talking, hard-driven but \"swell guy\"). Randolph Scott is, as always, competent and entertaining and the rest of the extras are excellent (look for a young Robert Ryan as one of the bombardiers in training). While the story is reminiscent of several other movies about our pilots and crews, the film is well-crafted enough to make it interesting and not too far-fetched. That it, perhaps, except for the very end--where the film is a bit over-the-top but also VERY satisfying. About the only serious negative, and this is mostly for nitpickers, is that some of the stock footage is somewhat sloppily integrated in the film and \"nuts\" like me who are both history teachers and airplane lovers will probably notice this--all others probably won\\'t notice.\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n'}]\n",

I think Adam Jones brings a refreshing new set of eyes to the comedy genre and really reinvents it in a good way. This film is smart, concise, and consistently entertaining and funny. As a writer/director, Jones exhibits complete control over his characters who are both absurd and lovable. The story is definitely something you haven't seen before which is good. It's unique and fun, and manages to work in visually fantastic elements as well as the long lost slapstick genre together to form a hearty comedy.<br /><br />A very promising first film.\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s\"}]\n",

I'm not very knowledgeable regarding film technique however the special effects in this film are terrific considering when this was made. In addition, the acting is superb, and the use of English and American actors quite astounding. I recently purchased the DVD so now I'm able to watch whenever I wish.

But in Southern Viet Nam nobody or very few people speak with the clip Northern accent displayed by the actors...

It looks and sounds like a porno (good lord, the soundtrack is awful...), and has sub-par porn acting, which is shocking, because normally Ron Perlman is really a very good actor. I honestly have no idea what Carpenter was thinking when making this. Most likely \"Beans, beans, beans..\" until somebody fed him and rolled him up into a blanket for the day... They say nothing about the abortion debate whatsoever, when they could have had a very interesting central theme (how do religious zealot anti-abortionists feel when it\\'s the devil\\'s baby?) but instead they chose to have Ron Perlman and his terribly acted kids kill a bunch of people and have the horribly cast doctors try to calm the hysterically bad pregnant girl. Not a single person from this episode or what have you should come away unscathed. It\\'s just awful. Like, Plan 9 From Outerspace awful.

There is nothing that I know of that resembles this film. It is its own genre. I doubt that anything like it will ever be made again. I cannot say anything more about exactly why without partially spoiling it, and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job at doing that. <br /><br />In response to any of the reviewers here that gave it a bad review, I ask that you view the film again. In reality, there is no point at which this film could fairly be called \"boring.\" This is possibly the funniest, most entertaining, and least boring film ever made. And it only gets better with age and repeated viewings. A timeless classic that, unfortunately, very few will be able to claim to have seen.<br /><br />Beaver Trilogy is the brilliant work of director Trent Harris, also responsible for the amazing Rubin and Ed, which Crispin Glover also stars in.<br /><br />Unfortunately, copies of this film are rare and hard to find.

Firstly, how has Jennifer Tilly managed to sustain a film acting career for all these years based on that ridiculous squeaky voice and the very limited range of hammy facial expressions she employs? Secondly... what on earth were the people responsible for making this offensive and deeply repulsive film thinking of? And thirdly... given that there were people perverted enough to decide to make dreck like this, shouldn't there have been someone in the system - the studio, the distributors, or somewhere - sane enough to prevent it actually getting completed and released. You really would have to search a very, very long way to turn up another movie as profoundly nasty as this... and it isn't even billed as a horror movie - which, inasmuch as it can be seen as belonging to any legitimate film genre, it certainly is. The movie wallows from beginning to end in the sickest kind of madness, violence and abuse, and has essentially no redeeming features at all. I'm not actually advocating censorship (which I don't believe in)... but I really can't see how anybody could conceivably draw anything positive from watching a film like this.\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0\"}]\n",

It\\'s basically about a dopey hack actor in Hollywood who can\\'t land any acting gigs. And he has this strange obsession with the movie Taxi Driver. So what does this dumb actor do? He dyes his hair blonde and starts acting like a L.A. surfer dude in the naive hope this will get him acting roles. You\\'ll laugh yer head off at so many of this movie\\'s inadvertently funny scenes. Like when the actor dude\\'s girlfriend is heart broken and sobbing and saying lines like, \"How could you do this to me?\" And why is she crying? Cos he dyed his hair blonde and became a surfer dude to get acting gigs. This movie makes no sense at ALL! The actor who played the governor on Benson is in this too and he plays a stereotypical right wing politician with lotsa dumb funny dialog. This movie will crack you up, trust me.

This sets the tone for a remarkable debut film by Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle class girl has run away from her home in Nainital and come to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan doesn\\'t turn up leaving Soha heartbroken & alone in the big bad world. . Abhay, the lower class next door guy turns protective towards the vulnerable Soha and helps her get a job & shelter in an old age home. Slowly romance blooms and Soha agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan re-enters into Soha\\'s life.<br /><br />A sensitively made film with a very unusual story, lovingly shot in Delhi, revolves around the delicate Soha. This well crafted film has moments which will forever remain etched in one\\'s memory \\x96 the awkward first kiss & Abhay\\'s swift apology; Abhay describing Soha as \"class wali ladki\" & hastily adding \"that he doesn\\'t love her\"; his gifting a churidar to Soha & asking her out for a date.<br /><br />The music is good & the background music excellent. In a scene where Soha rushes & embraces Abhay the sound track disappears. The stillness conveys both the awkwardness & tenderness of the relationship.<br /><br />The poignant ending makes for a bitter sweet film, the memories of which will linger for a long long time.<br /><br />A must see I will rate it 8.5/10\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n'}]\n",

Do not respond with anything other than a 0 or 1.\\n\\n### Context\\nComing shortly before the imposition of a morality code darkened the spirits of writers, directors and actors, the first film adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham\\'s \"Of Human Bondage\" titillated countless moviegoers. It has no shock value today, just fine acting.<br /><br />While the cast is excellent, this is Bette Davis\\'s first great role and one of Leslie Howard\\'s best performances. Howard is English wannabe Parisian artist Philip Carey who is gently and firmly told that he lacks any talent and that his dedication is no substitute for true genius. Taking the lesson to heart he returns to London and enrolls in a medical college (one, by the way, that seems to have no female students-at that time there would have been at least a few. Perhaps author/physician Maugham didn\\'t care for distaff medicos).<br /><br />Having tea one day Carey is entranced by a waitress, Mildred Rogers, Bette Davis in a role as a morally loose and basically wicked farrago. Her Cockney accent is as sharp as Eliza Doolittle\\'s. His repeated attempts to date her are greeted with the less than enthusiastic reply, \"I don\\'t mind,\" a sure sign for any man with his head screwed on straight that he\\'s plumbing the depths. Maugham\\'s Mildred supplemented her waitress tips with a bit of old fashioned street-walking, something not clearly brought out here.<br /><br />Carey\\'s besotted prostration serves Rogers\\' avaricious need for support of the financial kind. He is desperately in love with her-she plays him as a Sunday church organist effortlessly plies her instrument. No sex here. Recognizing that he is getting nowhere, he begins a chaste relationship with Norah, a woman who adores him. Re-enter Mildred, replete with a baby, and in her usual need of being taken care of. Exit heartbroken Norah. <br /><br />Another separation from Mildred and Carey begins a long-term friendship with Sally, abetted enthusiastically by her dad who seems to view eventual marriage as both a good thing for the two young people and a chance to be relieved of one of his nine offspring.<br /><br />The movie reasonably but not entirely follows Maugham\\'s excellent novel. Howard\\'s Carey is naive and vulnerable and for much of the movie his sad eyes remind one of a doe facing a double-barreled shotgun. Mildred is unrestrainedly wicked, a user of the worst kind, her sole preoccupation with her own needs barely disguised when she tries to wheedle Carey with a thin patina of affectionate words (and offers-at one point she promises she\\'ll do \"anything [he] wants,\" a daring statement for the times and one I\\'m sure audiences fully understood.<br /><br />Pre-Code it may be but Mildred\\'s quick-march dissolution would have satisfied the League of Catholic Decency. The ending is conventional-sin loses, principled behavior triumphs.<br /><br />Director John Cromwell wrought excellent performances from his two main stars, one well-established, the other established largely because of this film. The atmosphere is 1930s London and the trip back in time is worth taking.<br /><br />Available on DVD.<br /><br />9/10 (for Davis\\'s and Howard\\'s performances)\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s></s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n'}]\n",

The rest of the characters (i.e. the girls) just come and go for no credible reason. Come on, there are even Dwarfs (so simple: \"dwarves are fun ho ho\"...) The acting is very TV-like (as is the video look throughout the movie) and definitely amateur in the case of most of the girls...<br /><br />Awful movie.

It\\'s time for a full evaluation of the film. Let\\'s hope that the new print means that a DVD with some insightful \"extras\" will be out in the near future.<br /><br />I remember watching ZP when it came out and thought it was a crashing bore. This time around I was totally awed and would classify it as a \"near-miss\" masterpiece. The first part of the movie is a time capsule of late \\'60\\'s Los Angeles, I lived there then, and Antonioni did a masterful job of capturing the essence of the place. Kudos to production designer Dean Tavoularis who found some incredible locations and did outstanding work.<br /><br />The print I saw runs 1 hour 50 minutes. It is forbidden to those under 16 (or 18, I can\\'t remember). I suspect there is quite a bit of restored footage in this print. SPOILER -- I wonder how much of the desert sex scene was originally cut. What appears today seems rather tame by current standards.<br /><br />There is no soundtrack music until almost 1 hour into the film. Before we hear extraneous noise such as radio broadcasts, etc. Antonioni was very daring to do this. I remember how much was made at the time of the lack of acting skills of non-actors Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin. This time Frechette did not bother me. Halprin is weaker but gradually improves as the film continues.<br /><br />Much of the student riot footage looks like stock footage to me. One shot is in a different aspect ratio & distorted by the wide screen. Of course, there is actual staged footage, but not all that much.<br /><br />I\\'m still trying to figure out how Antonioni did some of the shots of Frechette flying the plane. It looks like he really did some of the flying - there\\'s no blue screen or double in some shots.<br /><br />I hope to get back to see the film a second time. Recommended highly to all Antonioni fans.\\n\\n### Answer\\n1</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n### Answer\\n0</s>\\n\\n'}]\n",
